If the user does mistakes while saying the rhyme then the Alexa will tell the user that the line said by you is wrong and also it will correct the line of the rhyme. It is very good skill for the user because in this skill we have added so many poems that the user will feel interesting while learning the poems and they will have fun while learning .If a user want to listen rhyme then invoke Alexa by saying rhyme tunes then Alexa will ask that which rhyme do you want to sing or play, and then Alexa will tell the first line of the rhyme and user should say the next line of the rhyme.
